# FYS4150 - Computational Physics

This is the repository for the course [FYS4150 - Computational Physics](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4150/) (University of Oslo) and contains the work of aleksda, samuelbrandt and shirdarec

## Project 1: The 1-Dimensional Poisson Equation

In this project, we solved the 1D poisson equation with boundary conditions. The methods use where LU Decomposition.

You can find the work in the [Project1](https://github.com/aleksda/FYS4150/tree/master/Project1) folder
